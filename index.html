              Greatness isn’t just about putting up numbers—it’s about doing it efficiently. The scatter plot of usage rate vs. true shooting percentage is a fascinating insight into how each player balances responsibility and efficiency.
              Jordan took on an immense scoring burden and still remained deadly efficient. LeBron, known for his court vision and playmaking, has found a way to maximize his efficiency while involving his teammates. Their approaches differ, but their results remain the same—greatness measured in numbers and impact.
